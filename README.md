# Aerosol-Be7-Deposition

This repos includes the code for simulating the aerosol Be7 concentration and its corresponding deposition velocity (dry and wet). The observational data is from the GEOTRACES project GP15, GP17 and GS02. If you use this code and similution results, please cite the paper which will be added here after it came out. Thank you!
